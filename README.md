# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a Python project that helps manage books in a library. It uses classes and objects to represent books and the library. The system allows users to:

*1. Add books (with title and author).*  
*2. View all books (including their availability status).*  
*3. Borrow books (mark as borrowed if available).*  
*4. Return books (mark as available if borrowed).*  
   
The program uses a menu-driven approach, making it interactive and user-friendly. It demonstrates concepts like object-oriented programming, file I/O, and dynamic user interaction in Python.
